# My Scripts

This repository contains a collection of personal scripts and tools I use regularly to automate tasks, streamline workflows, and manage files. The scripts are organized by language, primarily **Bash** and **Python**, to keep everything tidy and easy to use.

## Folder Structure

- **bash/**: Bash scripts for system tasks, backups, and automation.
- **python/**: Python scripts for data processing, image manipulation, and other utilities.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before running any scripts, ensure that you have the necessary dependencies installed. For **Bash** scripts, you just need a Unix-based environment (Linux/macOS). For **Python** scripts, make sure you have Python 3.x installed.

```bash
# To install Python 3 (if needed)
sudo apt install python3
